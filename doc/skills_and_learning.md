# Skills and Learning Aspects – Face Recognition API Project

## Core Backend Skills (High Signal)

- FastAPI (async routes, dependency injection)
- REST API design (status codes, schemas, validation)
- PostgreSQL (schema design, indexing, constraints)
- SQLAlchemy ORM (async usage)
- Alembic migrations
- Environment configuration (dotenv)

## Computer Vision & ML Skills

### Foundational
- Image formats, decoding, resizing
- Face detection vs recognition distinction
- Bounding boxes and alignment

### Intermediate
- Pretrained face detectors (MTCNN / RetinaFace)
- Face embeddings (ArcFace / FaceNet)
- Embedding normalization
- Cosine similarity vs Euclidean distance
- Threshold tuning and false positives

### Advanced (Optional Extensions)
- pgvector for ANN search
- Batch inference
- Live webcam pipelines
- Performance profiling (CPU inference)

## Engineering & Dev Practices

- Modular code architecture
- Async I/O reasoning
- Structured logging
- Error handling for ML failures
- API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Pytest for services
- Docker for local dev

## Ethics & Privacy Awareness

- Explicit consent for face registration
- No third-party data storage
- Ability to delete user embeddings
- Clear project disclaimer

## Why This Skill Set Matters

This stack aligns with:
- ML engineering internships
- Backend-heavy AI roles
- Applied computer vision teams
- Startups using Supabase/PostgreSQL
